Applicable to RAMBo version 1.2

You should be able to get the patch from the vendor where you received the RAMBo.

The patch is a varistor between the USB ground and primary ground to provide a path for ESD to the USB shield.

The plug-in-patch uses part number VA100026D580DL between GND pins in ICSP1 and Serial extensions. If you are using the serial extension you can use GND in ICSP, I2C, or Z-MAX. The varistor should be completely covered in heat shrink tubing.

The SMT patch uses part CG0603MLC-05E.
